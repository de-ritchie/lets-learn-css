Responsive Design

3 ingredients to responsive web design
*   Fluid Grid: All layout elements are sized in relative
    units, such percentages, instead of absolute units like pixels.
*   Flexible images: are also sized in relative units.
*   Media queries: allow us to specify different CSS style 
    rules for different browser widths.
